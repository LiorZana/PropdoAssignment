Propdo Frontend Home Assignment

(Approximate time 1 day)

At Propdo, we strive to build interfaces that are simple and easy to use. As a Frontend Engineer, you are responsible for implementing how our users interact with our website. 

Our frontend is coded in React using the following key packages – so please keep this in mind when completing the assignment:

 • React with hooks (we don’t use classes)
 ◦ useContext 
 • Material-UI
 • react-router-dom
 • react-mapbox-gl 
 • Typescript (Bonus)

Please complete the following exercises in a single React project.

**Exercise 1**

The goal of this exercise is to create a listings site. To help you achieve this, you have been supplied with dummy images as well as a json file (transactions.json) containing dummy real-estate listings to simulate the data you would receive from our backend. Within your solution, please complete the following:

 • Create a page - /real-estate
 • Load the json and present them in the best way you can think to – simulate an external API call
 • Expected Functionality:
 a. Search box to search for the property by address
 b. Filter by number of rooms
 c. Sort listings by price

**Exercise 2**

This exercise focuses on your logical and functional coding with the goal of testing your abilities to work with the react-mapbox-gl package (Note you will need to sign up and create a free API token: https://www.mapbox.com)

Within your solution, please complete the following:

 • Create a page - /map
 • Create a map using mapbox-gl defaulting to show Israel
 • Create two input boxes for GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude)
 • Expected Functionality:
 a. Enter GPS into inputs – map must zoom to coordinates

 b. Click on map – coordinates must be shown in the GPS input box

BONUS – draw a circle of radius 100m around the GPS point
In your response, please include a link to the GitHub Repository of your code as well as a link to your deployed website.
